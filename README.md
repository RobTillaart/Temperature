# Temperature

Arduino library with dewPoint, humidex, heatIndex and windchill functions.

## Description

This library contains some weather related functions. These functions
are approximations based on work of NOAA a.o.

These functions can be used with temperature and humidity sensors e.g.
DHT22 or Sensirion ones to make a weather station application.


## Operations

The functions have a limited scope so one cannot use it for all input values possible.
The user should be aware of that. Check the references mentioned in the code and or
wikipedia to confirm the applicability of the values generated.
The functions do not check the inputs.

See examples for typical usage.
